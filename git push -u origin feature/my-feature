## Tool Roles
- **ChatGPT**: Planning, decomposing tasks, explaining errors, drafting Aider prompts.
- **Aider + Qwen3**: Multi-file edits, new files, refactors, auto-commits.
- **Unreal Engine + Visual Studio**: Compile, run, validate.
- **Git/GitHub**: History, backup, code review.

## Tips
- Always run Aider with `--edit-format whole`.
- Use clear file paths and include full file content in prompts.
- Keep prompts small and compilable; commit after each step.
- Set `OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:11434` to avoid warnings.
- When fixing build errors, be specific about which error you're addressing.
