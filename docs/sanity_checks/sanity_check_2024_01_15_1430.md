# SANITY CHECK - 2024-01-15 14:30 - DAILY

**CHECK TYPE**: Daily

**BUILD STATUS**: üü¢ HEALTHY

**BUILD VALIDATION**:
- Plugin builds successfully: ‚úÖ
- Plugin loads in editor: ‚úÖ
- UI panel functional: ‚úÖ
- Core features working: ‚úÖ
- Build warnings: None
- Build errors: None

**SHORT-TERM GOALS** (Next 1-7 days):
- [x] Goal 1: Complete UI implementation for texture optimization
- [ ] Goal 2: Implement texture analysis algorithms
- [ ] Goal 3: Add unit tests for core functionality

**MEDIUM-TERM GOALS** (Next 1-4 weeks):
- [ ] Goal 1: Complete texture optimization engine
- [ ] Goal 2: Implement user settings and configuration
- [ ] Goal 3: Add performance monitoring and logging

**LONG-TERM GOALS** (Next 1-6 months):
- [ ] Goal 1: Complete plugin packaging and distribution
- [ ] Goal 2: User testing and feedback integration
- [ ] Goal 3: Performance optimization and benchmarking

**ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT**:
- ‚úÖ **ON TRACK**: UI development progressing well, build system stable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS ATTENTION**: Need to focus more on core algorithms
- ‚ùå **OFF TRACK**: None

**BUILD SYSTEM ASSESSMENT**:
- ‚úÖ **WORKING WELL**: Plugin builds cleanly, loads in editor without issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**: Build times could be optimized
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES**: None

**NEXT ACTIONS**:
- Action 1: Implement texture analysis algorithms (Developer, this week)
- Action 2: Add unit tests for existing functionality (Developer, this week)
- Action 3: Optimize build process (Developer, next week)

**OVERALL STATUS**: üü¢ ON TRACK
